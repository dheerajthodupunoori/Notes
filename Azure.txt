What is Cloud?
--------------
Infrastructure as a Servcie (Iaas)  - provides all infrastructure needed for computing environment.Virtual machines , networking , ip addresses , storage space. 


Microsoft Azure - public cloud offering.


Platform as a Service (Paas) - Azure App Services , SQL Azure



Software as a Service (Saas) - Office 365  



Reasons for choosing cloud:-
---------------------------
1.Reduced time - can be configured in less tim.

2.Less cost - costs less as we pay only for what we use / how much we use.

3.Ease of use - no need to buy any physical server and no maintenance.

4.Scalability - up when needed / down when not required.

5.Pay for what you use.

Compute services / compute options in Azure:-
--------------------------------------------
Compute in cloud - means CPU and the memory that you are going to use to run your application code.




1.Virtual machines - we can create Linux VM , Windows VM.


2.Azure app Services - is all about providing platform for running web applications . What ever may the language used.


3.Containers -  Azure has full support for kubernetes services.


4.Serverless - Azure functions , Logic Apps , Event Grid.

Serverless computing do not require any infrastructure setup.


	Azure functions - a piece of function (a simple function like in any programming language) which can be written in any language which are triggered by external sources(any http request).

	Event Grid -  publish and subscribe kind of events.

Introduction to Azure App Services:
-----------------------------------

Web Apps - to host web applications

API Apps - to host API's / expose API's

Mobile Apps

Logic Apps

Function Apps - serverless piecses of code


1.What are Azure App Services  -  

2.When and why you should use Azure App Services  -  

3.Capabilities of each service  -  


Hosting Web Applications with Web Apps:
---------------------------------------
Traditional web hosting - in traditional web hosting we need to take of entire infrastructure like 
Miantaining the Server in which we are going to host our application ,

firewall settings,

configuration settings (configuring web server) etc kind of things which is alot of work and efforts required.

Azure Web App:
--------------
In Azure web Apps , we just need to concentrate only on application and bussiness values.

We can host any kind of web application in azure web app like .net , php , python , java , node.js etc 


1.SLA 99.95% - azure web app makes sures that your web application is up and running 99.95% 
2.Custom domains 
3.Deployment slots
4.Continuous deployment
5.(Auto) scaling
6.Authentication / Authorization 
7.Traffic Management
8.Access to on-premises data - which allows the web application we deployed in azure web app to communicate with on-premises data like database server etc .




Deployment slots - it is a feature of app services. It is used to setup environments for testing etc .

->we can create upto 19 deployment slots.
->a deployment slot is full web app
->scaling is only possible in production slot
->deployment slot is not good for performance testing , because sacling is not possible unless its a production slot
