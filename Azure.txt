What is Cloud?
--------------
Infrastructure as a Servcie (Iaas)  - provides all infrastructure needed for computing environment.Virtual machines , networking , ip addresses , storage space. 


Microsoft Azure - public cloud offering.


Platform as a Service (Paas) - Azure App Services , SQL Azure



Software as a Service (Saas) - Office 365  



Reasons for choosing cloud:-
---------------------------
1.Reduced time - can be configured in less tim.

2.Less cost - costs less as we pay only for what we use / how much we use.

3.Ease of use - no need to buy any physical server and no maintenance.

4.Scalability - up when needed / down when not required.

5.Pay for what you use.
