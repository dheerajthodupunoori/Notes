When Docker runs a container, it runs an image inside it. This image is usually built by executing a series of Docker instructions, which add layers on top of existing image or OS distribution.



Defining an environment variable:
---------------------------------
ENV name Manu --- defining an environment variable or simply a variable with variable name as "name" and value as "Manu"
ENTRYPOINT echo "Hello, $name"

when container runs as docker run -it <image-nam> will produce output

Output :- Hello, Manu












QUESTIONS?
----------
1. What is the difference between CMD and ENTRYPOINT?
Answer:- CMD is the default instruction which will executed when we run a container , but if we want to overwrite the arguments at the runtime , we can do it by providing the values at runtime.Whereas , ENTRYPOINT instruction is also same as CMD instruction , but we cannot override the ENTRYPOINT instruction as like CMD instruction.

Example for CMD instruction:
Lets take a sample docker file 
Dockerfile:

FROM ubuntu:16.04
CMD echo "Welcome to CMD"

when we docker build and docker run the container , 

docker run -it "image name"
OUTPUT:- Welcome to CMD.

Now lets overwrite

docker run -it echo "Welcome to Docker"
OUTPUT:Welcome to Docker.


Example for ENTRYPOINT instruction:
Lets take a sample docker file 
Dockerfile:

FROM ubuntu:16.04
ENTRYPOINT ["echo", "Hi Docker"]

when we docker build and docker run the container , 

docker run -it "image name"
OUTPUT:- Hi Docker.

Now lets overwrite

docker run -it echo "Welcome to Docker"
OUTPUT:Hi Docker echo Welcome to Docker.

so , we cannot override ENTRYPOINT instruction , instead it appends to that instruction(echo "Welcome to Docker" will be appended).



2.Can we use multiple CMD instruations in Dockerfile?
Answer:- When we write multiple command instructions , docker will consider only the latest CMD instruction and ignores the remaining ones.

Example:
Lets take a sample docker file 
Dockerfile:

FROM ubuntu:16.04
CMD echo "Welcome to CMD"
CMD echo "Welcome to Python"

when we docker build and docker run the container , 

docker run -it "image name"
OUTPUT:- Welcome to Python"

CMD echo "Welcome to CMD" is ignored.

Now lets overwrite

docker run -it echo "Welcome to Docker"
OUTPUT:Welcome to Docker.
